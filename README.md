# Reinforcement Learning Codebase

## Overview

I created this codebase to learn about Reinforcement Learning. I really am fascinated by the concept and would like to play around with different simulations/environments/architectures and see what kinds of cool things I can create. This codebase is intended to start very simply in order to learn the fundamentals.
