# Reinforcement Learning Codebase

## Overview

I created this codebase to learn about Reinforcement Learning. I really am fascinated by the concept and would like to play around with different simulations/environments/architectures and see what kinds of cool things I can create. This codebase is intended to start very simply in order to learn the fundamentals.

## Elements
### Simplest
An extremely simple example of a Q Learning Table learning a binary choice 'game'. Its not really even a game - just choose 0 if the state is 0 and 1 if the state is 1. Nice to illustrate the simplest possible example.


## Medium
Work in progess. The idea here is to train a model to play a simple resource gathering game.

## Hard
