## Overview

After creating a simple example of RL, I wanted to step up the complexity. 

Brainstorming on how to improve the complexity:
    - Could do more states and actions, same as the simple example (this won't be a meaningful increase in complexity)
    - Have an agent that can move right or left and its goal is to get to the light. If it gets to the light, it wins
        - This could be visualized
