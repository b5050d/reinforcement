# Medium Model

My first attempts at the medium model were a failure and I need to refactor things to be easier to work with and clearer as to what is actually going on.

## Ideas for improvement
- ramp up the training - Start with a consistent environment then move to a slightly off environment and then move to a fully random environment in turn. this should allow our model to learn basic navigation skills first.

- Could start with just one food, and then move up from there

- going to have the environment be a matrix


### Curriculum Brainstorming
- Looks like on a small map with a single resource
