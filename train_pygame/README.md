# Training on Pygame Simulation

Alright so the thought here is to create a basic simulation that both the human and the AI can participate in.

Pygame can be used to allow the user to play but the game should be accessible to the AI and run headless


Thoughts on the encoding of environment observation
dist_x, dist_y, active and repeating as such
This keeps the observation space consistent
